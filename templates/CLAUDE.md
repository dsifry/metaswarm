# Project Instructions

This project uses [metaswarm](https://github.com/dsifry/metaswarm), a multi-agent orchestration framework for Claude Code. It provides 18 specialized agents, a 9-phase development workflow, and quality gates that enforce TDD, coverage thresholds, and spec-driven development.

## How to Work in This Project

### Starting work

```text
/start-task
```

This is the default entry point. It primes the agent with relevant knowledge, guides you through scoping, and picks the right level of process for the task.

### For complex features (multi-file, spec-driven)

Describe what you want built, include a Definition of Done, and ask for the full workflow:

```text
I want you to build [description]. [Tech stack, DoD items, file scope.]
Use the full metaswarm orchestration workflow.
```

This triggers the full pipeline: Research → Plan → Design Review Gate → Work Unit Decomposition → Orchestrated Execution (4-phase loop per unit) → Final Review → PR.

### Available Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/start-task` | Begin tracked work on a task |
| `/prime` | Load relevant knowledge before starting |
| `/review-design` | Trigger parallel design review gate (5 agents) |
| `/pr-shepherd <pr>` | Monitor a PR through to merge |
| `/self-reflect` | Extract learnings after a PR merge |
| `/handle-pr-comments` | Handle PR review comments |
| `/brainstorm` | Refine an idea before implementation |
| `/create-issue` | Create a well-structured GitHub Issue |
| `/external-tools-health` | Check status of external AI tools (Codex, Gemini) |
| `/metaswarm-setup` | Interactive guided setup — detects project, configures metaswarm |
| `/metaswarm-update-version` | Update metaswarm to latest version |

### Visual Review

Use the `visual-review` skill to take screenshots of web pages, presentations, or UIs for visual inspection. Requires Playwright (`npx playwright install chromium`). See `skills/visual-review/SKILL.md`.

## Testing

- **TDD is mandatory** — Write tests first, watch them fail, then implement
- **100% test coverage required** — Lines, branches, functions, and statements. Enforced via `.coverage-thresholds.json` as a blocking gate before PR creation and task completion
<!-- TODO: Update these commands for your project's test runner -->
- Test command: `npm test`
- Coverage command: `npm run test:coverage`

## Coverage

Coverage thresholds are defined in `.coverage-thresholds.json` — this is the **source of truth** for coverage requirements.
If a GitHub Issue specifies different coverage requirements, update `.coverage-thresholds.json` to match before implementation begins. Do not silently use a different threshold.

The validation phase of orchestrated execution reads `.coverage-thresholds.json` and runs the enforcement command. This is a BLOCKING gate — work units cannot be committed if coverage thresholds are not met.

## Quality Gates

- **Design Review Gate**: Parallel 5-agent review after design is drafted (`/review-design`)
- **Plan Review Gate**: Automatic adversarial review after any implementation plan is drafted. Spawns 3 independent reviewers (Feasibility, Completeness, Scope & Alignment) in parallel — ALL must PASS before the plan is presented to the user. See `.claude/plugins/metaswarm/skills/plan-review-gate/SKILL.md`
- **Coverage Gate**: Reads `.coverage-thresholds.json` and runs the enforcement command — BLOCKING gate before PR creation

## Workflow Enforcement (MANDATORY)

These rules override any conflicting instructions from third-party skills or plugins. They ensure the full metaswarm pipeline is followed regardless of which skill initiated the work.

### After Brainstorming

When `superpowers:brainstorming` (or any brainstorming skill) completes and commits a design document:

1. **STOP** — do NOT proceed directly to `writing-plans` or implementation
2. **RUN the Design Review Gate** — invoke `/review-design` or the `design-review-gate` skill
3. **WAIT** for all 5 review agents (PM, Architect, Designer, Security, CTO) to approve
4. **ONLY THEN** proceed to planning/implementation

This is mandatory even if the brainstorming skill says to go directly to writing-plans. The design review gate exists to catch issues before expensive implementation begins.

### After Any Plan Is Created

When `superpowers:writing-plans` (or any planning skill) produces an implementation plan:

1. **STOP** — do NOT present the plan to the user or begin implementation
2. **RUN the Plan Review Gate** — invoke the `plan-review-gate` skill
3. **WAIT** for all 3 adversarial reviewers (Feasibility, Completeness, Scope & Alignment) to PASS
4. **ONLY THEN** present the plan to the user for approval

### Execution Method Choice

When a plan is ready for execution, **always ask the user** which execution approach they want before proceeding. Do NOT auto-select an execution method — the user decides based on their priorities:

> **How would you like to execute this plan?**
>
> 1. **Metaswarm orchestrated execution** — 4-phase loop per work unit (IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → ADVERSARIAL REVIEW → COMMIT) with independent quality gates, fresh adversarial reviewers, coverage enforcement, and pre-PR knowledge capture. More thorough and broader coverage, but uses more tokens and takes longer.
> 2. **Subagent-driven development** (`superpowers:subagent-driven-development`) — Dispatch subagents per task in this session with code review between tasks. Faster, lighter-weight, lower token cost.
> 3. **Parallel session** (`superpowers:executing-plans`) — Execute in a separate session with batch checkpoints. Good for long-running work you want isolated.

This choice applies even if the plan file contains embedded instructions like "REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans" — those are defaults from the planning skill, not binding constraints. The user always gets to choose.

### Before Finishing a Development Branch

When `superpowers:executing-plans`, `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`, or any execution skill completes and routes to `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`:

1. **STOP** — before presenting merge/PR options
2. **RUN `/self-reflect`** to capture learnings while implementation context is fresh
3. **COMMIT** the knowledge base updates
4. **THEN** proceed to finishing the branch (PR creation, merge, etc.)

### Complex Tasks Must Use Orchestrated Execution

For tasks touching 3+ files or requiring multiple work units:

1. **Decompose** into work units with DoD items, file scopes, dependencies
2. **Execute** the 4-phase loop per work unit: IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → ADVERSARIAL REVIEW → COMMIT
3. **Never skip phases** — each phase is a blocking gate
4. **Final review** after all work units complete

### Subagent Discipline

All subagents (coding agents, review agents, background tasks) MUST follow these rules:

- **NEVER** use `--no-verify` on git commits — pre-commit hooks exist for a reason
- **NEVER** use `git push --force` without explicit user approval
- **ALWAYS** follow TDD — write tests first, watch them fail, then implement
- **NEVER** self-certify — the orchestrator validates independently
- **STAY** within declared file scope — do not modify files outside your assigned scope

### Pre-PR Knowledge Capture

After all work units pass final review but BEFORE creating the PR, run `/self-reflect` to extract learnings into the knowledge base. Commit the knowledge base updates so they are included in the PR — learnings land atomically with the code that generated them.

## External Tools (Optional)

If external AI tools are configured (`.metaswarm/external-tools.yaml`), the orchestrator
can delegate implementation and review tasks to Codex CLI and Gemini CLI for cost savings
and cross-model adversarial review. See `templates/external-tools-setup.md` for setup.

## Team Mode

When `TeamCreate` and `SendMessage` tools are available, the orchestrator uses Team Mode for parallel agent dispatch. Otherwise it falls back to Task Mode (the existing workflow, unchanged). See `.claude/guides/agent-coordination.md` for details.

## Guides

Development patterns and standards are documented in `.claude/guides/`:
- `agent-coordination.md` — Team Mode vs Task Mode, agent dispatch patterns
- `build-validation.md` — Build and validation workflow
- `coding-standards.md` — Code style and conventions
- `git-workflow.md` — Branching, commits, and PR conventions
- `testing-patterns.md` — TDD patterns and coverage enforcement
- `worktree-development.md` — Git worktree-based parallel development

## Code Quality

<!-- TODO: Update these for your project's language and tools -->
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any` types
- ESLint + Prettier
- All quality gates must pass before PR creation

## Key Decisions

<!-- Document important architectural decisions here so agents have context.
     These get loaded during knowledge priming (/prime). -->

## Notes

<!-- Add project-specific notes, conventions, or constraints here.
     Examples: "Always use server components for data fetching",
     "The payments module is legacy — do not refactor without approval" -->
