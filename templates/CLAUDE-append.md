## metaswarm

This project uses [metaswarm](https://github.com/dsifry/metaswarm) for multi-agent orchestration with Claude Code. It provides 18 specialized agents, a 9-phase development workflow, and quality gates that enforce TDD, coverage thresholds, and spec-driven development.

### Workflow

- **Most tasks**: `/start-task` — primes context, guides scoping, picks the right level of process
- **Complex features** (multi-file, spec-driven): Describe what you want built with a Definition of Done, then tell Claude: `Use the full metaswarm orchestration workflow.`

### Available Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/start-task` | Begin tracked work on a task |
| `/prime` | Load relevant knowledge before starting |
| `/review-design` | Trigger parallel design review gate (5 agents) |
| `/pr-shepherd <pr>` | Monitor a PR through to merge |
| `/self-reflect` | Extract learnings after a PR merge |
| `/handle-pr-comments` | Handle PR review comments |
| `/brainstorm` | Refine an idea before implementation |
| `/create-issue` | Create a well-structured GitHub Issue |

### Quality Gates

- **Design Review Gate** — Parallel 5-agent review after design is drafted (`/review-design`)
- **Plan Review Gate** — Automatic adversarial review after any implementation plan is drafted. Spawns 3 independent reviewers (Feasibility, Completeness, Scope & Alignment) in parallel — ALL must PASS before presenting the plan. See `.claude/plugins/metaswarm/skills/plan-review-gate/SKILL.md`
- **Coverage Gate** — `.coverage-thresholds.json` defines thresholds. BLOCKING gate before PR creation

### Team Mode

When `TeamCreate` and `SendMessage` tools are available, the orchestrator uses Team Mode for parallel agent dispatch. Otherwise it falls back to Task Mode (existing workflow, unchanged). See `.claude/guides/agent-coordination.md` for details.

### Guides

Development patterns and standards are documented in `.claude/guides/` — covering agent coordination, build validation, coding standards, git workflow, testing patterns, and worktree development.

### Testing & Quality

- **TDD is mandatory** — Write tests first, watch them fail, then implement
- **100% test coverage required** — Enforced via `.coverage-thresholds.json` as a blocking gate before PR creation and task completion
- **Coverage source of truth** — `.coverage-thresholds.json` defines thresholds. Update it if your spec requires different values. The orchestrator reads it during validation — this is a BLOCKING gate.

### Workflow Enforcement (MANDATORY)

These rules override any conflicting instructions from third-party skills:

- **After brainstorming** → MUST run Design Review Gate (5 agents) before writing-plans or implementation
- **After any plan is created** → MUST run Plan Review Gate (3 adversarial reviewers) before presenting to user
- **Execution method choice** → ALWAYS ask the user whether to use metaswarm orchestrated execution (more thorough, uses more tokens) or superpowers execution skills (faster, lighter-weight). Never auto-select.
- **Before finishing a branch** → MUST run `/self-reflect` and commit knowledge base updates before PR creation
- **Subagents** → NEVER use `--no-verify`, ALWAYS follow TDD, NEVER self-certify, STAY within file scope
