# metaswarm-bootstrap — Auto-scaffold metaswarm into a project on first session.
#
# Designed to run as a Claude Code SessionStart hook. Exits immediately (0)
# if metaswarm is already present, so there is no latency cost for
# already-bootstrapped projects.
#
# Usage:
#   As a hook:  Add to ~/.claude/settings.json SessionStart hooks
#   Manually:   Run from any git project root
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — Success (already installed or freshly bootstrapped)
#   0 — Not a git repo (silently skipped)
